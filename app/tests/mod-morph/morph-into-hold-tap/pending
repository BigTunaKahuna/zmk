This test fails when the hold-tap is decided to resolve as tap. In this case, as soon as
the hold-tap decision is made, the mod-morph is released. This triggers the
`.binding_released` function of the `mod-morph` behavior, clearing the `masked_mods`
before the actual tap-binding of the `hold-tap` gets registered.

If the hold-tap is decided to resolve as hold, the mod-morph isn't released, and
`masked_mods` are cleared correctly.
